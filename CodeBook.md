All the variables listed in "features.txt" were included in the analysis (n=561). All the data in train and test were combined into one data frame. Labels were added by merging the labels in "activity_labels.txt" by the labels obtained from "y_train.txt" and "y_test.txt". The data was split by activity label and subject number and then the column means were taken from the split data.
